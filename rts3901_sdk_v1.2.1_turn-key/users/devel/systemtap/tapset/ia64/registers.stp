/*
 * Dwarfless register access for ia64. Unfortunately, getting
 * registers/arguments on the ia64 is unimplemented (because it is
 * non-trivial retrieving the arguments from the stack).
 *
 * Note that using syscall_get_arguments() (as the s390x does) doesn't
 * work on ia64.
 *
 * The rest of this file would be intentionally blank until ia64
 * register/argument support is added, but tapset files can't be
 * completely empty.
